# Autism-3D-CNN-brain-sMRI

This project aimed at training 3D-CNN models to predict Autism on structural brain MRI data.

We also used the Guided Grad-CAM and HighRes3DNet algorithms in order to build a method of interpretation of the trained models. 

The abstract ***Towards building an interpretable predictive tool for ASD with 3D Convolutional Neural Networks*, MÃ©lanie Garcia, Clare Kelly** was introduced at the conference the Organization for Human Brain Mapping 2022 held in Glasgow in June 2022.

Preprint released soon !
